! This is a dummy waste heat function of temp curve required for the
! multispeed coils. The curve is set as a constant curve that would yield
! a factor of 1 at all temperatures for simplicity.
! However, this curve is not used if the fuel type is electricity (which is
! what we limit ourselves to in terms of multispeed DX equipment) per
! the E+ version 8.0 I/O reference Page 1301.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.

!- For multifamily buildings, we assume that the blower door test
!- is conducted separately for each apartment. The Sherman-Grimsrud
!- infiltration model uses Effective Leakage Area coupled with
!- the outdoor air temperature to calculate the infiltration load.
!- While this approach is correct for the singlefamily prototype,
!- it may overstate infiltration loads for the multifamily prototype
!- as the apartments have shared walls with zones on both sides being
!- pressurized in reality. To account for this reduced leakage in
!- multifamily buildings, the ELA for each unit is adjusted based on
!- the ratio of exterior surface to total surface area.
